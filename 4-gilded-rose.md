## Tests as refactoring harness

A good kata for using tests as a refactoring harness is the [Gilded Rose Kata](https://github.com/jimweirich/gilded_rose_kata) (linked to the Ruby version by Jim Weirich).

If you're interested in some great discussion on this kata (best viewed after you've given it a stab), check out [Sandi Metz's discussion on refactoring](http://www.confreaks.com/videos/3358-railsconf-all-the-little-things) with this kata.
