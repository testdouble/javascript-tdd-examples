The first exercise we did is often called "classical TDD". It works well when you're
defining a well-defined, difficult-to-reduce pure function (like the Bowling Kata).
In classical TDD, abstractions are made after tests and code have been initially developed,
often requiring rework in both. In what I call "Discovery TDD" (also "London-style", "mockist", and "GOOS"),
abstractions are iterated on as a first step when authoring the test.

Here's my [blog post](http://blog.testdouble.com/posts/2014-01-25-the-failures-of-intro-to-tdd.html) on that topic.
